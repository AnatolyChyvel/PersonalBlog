This blog is designed to teach the craft of a back-end developer. During development we used pure php 7.1, no frameworks. The architecture is built using the MVC pattern and route. Email confirmation works only with a configured server (in my case, OpenServer). The Composer package manager was used to download packages and libraries. On the client side, Ajax was used to load comments in real time, and a small API was developed to handle requests. Markdown markup is used to format the text. To work with the database, I used technologies: ORM, ActiveRecord, as well as Reflection API.

### How to install:
* Install packages (run composer install in the server console).
* Import the database in DB folder to your server.
* Specify DB connection parameters in .env.
* Configure the server to send Email.
